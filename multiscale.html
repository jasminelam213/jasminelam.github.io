            <p>In this project, I designed a multi-scale interactive prototype in Figma to address usability issues commonly found in recipe websitesâ€”particularly the need for constant scrolling, which disrupts the cooking experience. The goal was to reimagine recipe interaction across three physical display scales: inch-scale, foot-scale, and yard-scale, each tailored to different user contexts.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                  Most recipe websites are not optimized for real-world cooking scenarios. Users are forced to scroll constantly, navigate through ads, pop-ups, and long blog intros just to access step-by-step instructions or ingredient lists. This creates a frustrating and inefficient experience, especially when hands are messy or time is limited in the kitchen.

            <ul>
                <li>
                  Inch-scale for quick-glance access (e.g., timers or steps on a smartwatch)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Foot-scale for interactive browsing (e.g., managing ingredients or editing servings on a tablet)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Yard-scale for hands-free, large-display use (e.g., step-by-step guidance on a smart kitchen screen)
                </li>
                <li>
                  This solution reduces cognitive load, minimizes the need to touch or scroll, and improves usability by tailoring the interface to the physical context in which cooking happens.

        <h4 class="overviewtitle">The Process</h4>
        <div class="overview">
            <p>When I first started this project, I had a minimal understanding about what it meant to create
              an inch-scale, foot-scale, and yard-scale design. I had to do some research on what it meant to create a multi-scale design. 
              I learned that it is important to consider the physical context in which the user will be using the product. I also 
              learned that it is important to consider the user's needs 
              and how they will interact with the product at different scales. For my first design
              I had replicated the messages app on the Apple Watch.

      <div class="overviewhead">
        <h4 class="overviewtitle">Outcome</h4>
        <div class="overview">
            <p>I realized that the inch-scale design was not very useful 
              for a recipe app. I then decided to create a new inch-scale 
              design that would be more useful for a recipe app. 
              I created a new inch-scale design that would allow the user 
              to quickly glance at the ingredients and steps of the recipe without 
              having to scroll. I also created a foot-scale design that would allow 
              the user to interact with the recipe in a more hands-on way, such as e
              diting the servings or managing the ingredients. Finally, I created 
              a yard-scale design that would allow the user to follow the recipe 
              step-by-step without having to touch or scroll.
